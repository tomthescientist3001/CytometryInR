This is an example of turning in an assignment.

# Problem 1
Based on the PeacoQC package documentation (version 1.20.0), the package contains 5 main functions.

# Problem 2
There are currently 69 packages under FlowCytometry. The most author/maintainer is Givanna Putri with the package "SuperCellCyto".

# Problem 3
 Installation Method 1: we need different commands for different sources:
    install.packages() for CRAN packages
    BiocManager::install() for Bioconductor packages
    remotes::install_github() for GitHub packages

Installation Method 1(with pak): one command pak::pkg_install() works for all packages, no matter where they come from. It automatically figures out if a package is from CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub. However, dependencies were tricky because I needed to find the correct GitHub addresses, which could slow down the process.
